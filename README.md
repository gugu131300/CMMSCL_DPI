# CMMSCL-DPI
**Cross-Modal Multi-Structural Contrastive Learning for Predicting Drug-Protein Interactions**
--------

# üìå Abstract 
Predicting drug-protein interactions (DPI) is essential for effective and safe drug discovery. Although deep learning methods have been extensively applied to DPI prediction, effectively leveraging the multi-structural and multi-modal data of drugs and proteins to enhance prediction accuracy remains a significant challenge. This study proposed CMMSCL-DPI, a cross-modal multi-structural contrastive learning model. CMMSCL-DPI applies contrastive learning to the multi-dimensional structural features of proteins and drugs separately and integrates interaction features from a DPI heterogeneous graph network to facilitate cross-modal contrastive learning. This approach effectively captures the key differences and similarities between proteins and drugs, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capabilities for novel drug-target pairs. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMMSCL-DPI outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline models in overall performance. Additionally, the model successfully identified an unreported drug-protein interaction, which was subsequently validated through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. This case study not only confirms the predictive accuracy of CMMSCL-DPI but also underscores its potential in discovering novel protein-ligand interactions. In summary, CMMSCL-DPI exhibits high efficiency and broad applicability in advancing the drug discovery process.

CMMSCL-DPI is a **cross-modal multi-structural contrastive learning model** that:
- Extracts **multi-dimensional structural features** of proteins & drugs.
- Integrates **interaction features from a DPI heterogeneous graph network**.
- Enhances generalization to **novel drug-target pairs** via **contrastive learning**.

# üöÄ  How to run 
## 1„ÄÅTraining and testing on exsiting datasets

### Step 1: Obtain protein PDB structure files
python data_processing/download_all_pdb.py
### Step 2: Convert protein structures into graphs
python protein_graph.py
### Step 3: Convert compounds into molecular graphs
python compound_graph.py
### Step 4: Train & Test the model
python train_cl2RWR_class.py

-------


## 2„ÄÅTraining and testing on other datasets
If using a custom dataset, follow the same steps:

### Step 1: Obtain protein PDB structure files
python data_processing/download_all_pdb.py

1„ÄÅTo acquire the PDB structure files for proteins, the following input files are required:
Uniprot.txt ‚Äì This file contains the Uniprot IDs of all proteins, serving as the primary input.
non390_pidmapping.tsv ‚Äì This file maps each Uniprot ID to its corresponding PDB ID. The PDB IDs need to be retrieved from the UniProt ID mapping tool available at:
üëâ https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping
On the left panel, select "UniProtKB/AC ID" as the input.
On the right panel, choose "PDB" as the output.
This mapping file (non390_pidmapping.tsv) will then be used to fetch the relevant PDB structures for each protein.
2„ÄÅUse AlphaFold predictions if no PDB file is available.  
3„ÄÅSelect the best PDB file (based on resolution & coverage).
4„ÄÅConvert proteins & compounds into graphs.
5„ÄÅTrain & test the model.
### Step 2: Convert protein structures into graphs
python protein_graph.py
### Step 3: Convert compounds into molecular graphs
python compound_graph.py
### Step 4: Train & Test the model
python train_cl2RWR_class.py
