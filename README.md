# **CMMSCL-DPI**
**Cross-Modal Multi-Structural Contrastive Learning for Predicting Drug-Protein Interactions**
--------

# **üìå Abstract**
Predicting drug-protein interactions (DPI) is essential for effective and safe drug discovery. Although deep learning methods have been extensively applied to DPI prediction, effectively leveraging the multi-structural and multi-modal data of drugs and proteins to enhance prediction accuracy remains a significant challenge. This study proposed CMMSCL-DPI, a cross-modal multi-structural contrastive learning model. CMMSCL-DPI applies contrastive learning to the multi-dimensional structural features of proteins and drugs separately and integrates interaction features from a DPI heterogeneous graph network to facilitate cross-modal contrastive learning. This approach effectively captures the key differences and similarities between proteins and drugs, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capabilities for novel drug-target pairs. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMMSCL-DPI outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline models in overall performance. Additionally, the model successfully identified an unreported drug-protein interaction, which was subsequently validated through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. This case study not only confirms the predictive accuracy of CMMSCL-DPI but also underscores its potential in discovering novel protein-ligand interactions. In summary, CMMSCL-DPI exhibits high efficiency and broad applicability in advancing the drug discovery process.
